# _Object Detection Model_

#### _This web application is build to identify lifestyle objects in furniture images and access model performance with bounding box with unique color coding for every detected object, model performance, confusion matrix and the ability to download the result in a csv for furthur analysis. The trained model is yolov5 with 92% accuracy)_

## Technologies Used

* _Neural Networks_
* _Data Labelling using Labellimg and Azure data labelling tool_
* _YoloV5 Algorithm, Fastrcnnrestnet-50_
* _Azure AutoML_
* _YoloV5 (Best model so far)_
* _Streamlit_
* _Docker_



## Setting to change into feedback mechanism app 

* _Go app/Dockerfile_
* _Change requirements_model.txt to requirements_text_
* _Last line: Change the file name model_performance.py to image_object.py


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Install docker in system_
* _Add images folder in the /test directory if neccesary
* _Run: "docker-compose up" in your terminal inside your project folder path



## Known Bugs

* _No active session state_
* _Had to include more furtinure category in the selectbox_
* _Working on incorporating the feedback mechanism feature in same app_
